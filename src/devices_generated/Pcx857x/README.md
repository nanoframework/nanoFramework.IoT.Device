# NXP/TI PCx857x

The PCX857X device family provides 8/16-bit, general purpose parallel I/O expansion for I2C SPI applications. These chips provide simple I/O expansion with reduced bus traffic as they don't take command bytes.

## Documentation

PCX857X devices contain different markings to distinguish features like packaging, bus speed support, and address space.  Please review specific datasheet for more information.

var i2cDevice = I2cDevice.Create(connectionSettings);
var pcf8574 = new Pcf8574(i2cDevice);
```

## Binding Notes

This binding includes an `Pcx857x` abstract base class and derived abstract classes for both 8-bit (`Pcx8574`) and 16-bit (`Pcx8575`) variants.
