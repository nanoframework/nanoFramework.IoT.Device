## Usage
```C#
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Hmc5883l.DefaultI2cAddress);
I2cDevice device = I2cDevice.Create(settings);

using (Hmc5883l sensor = new Hmc5883l(device))
{
    // read direction vector
    Vector3 directionVector = sensor.DirectionVector;
    // read heading
    double heading = sensor.Heading;
    // read status
    Status status = sensor.DeviceStatus;
}

```
