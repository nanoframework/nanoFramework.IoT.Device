## Usage
```C#
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Max44009.DefaultI2cAddress);
I2cDevice device = I2cDevice.Create(settings);

// integration time is 100ms
using (Max44009 sensor = new Max44009(device, IntegrationTime.Time100))
{
    // read illuminance
    double illuminance = sensor.Illuminance;
}
```
