# SN74HC595 -- 8-Bit shift register driver app

This [test application](Program.cs) tests the [SN74HC595 binding](../README.md).

It supports GPIO and SPI. It supports daisy chaining. The test app supports up to 4 shift registers (up to 32-bits). It would be very easy to extend to a support more shift registers (switch from Int32 to Int64).
