# BlueNrg2 - Programmable Low-Energy Wireless System on Chip Bluetooth solution
#### Description on the ST website
> The BlueNRG-2 is a very low power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) single-mode system-on-chip, compliant with Bluetooth specifications. 
> The BlueNRG-2 extends the features of award-winning BlueNRG network processor, enabling the usage of the embedded Cortex M0 to run the user application code.
> The BlueNRG-2 includes 256 kB of programming Flash memory, 24 kB of static RAM memory with retention (two 12 kB banks) and SPI, UART, I2C standard communication interface peripherals. 
> It also features multifunction timers, watchdog, RTC and DMA controller.
> An ADC is available to interface with analog sensors, and to read the measurement of the integrated battery voltage sensor. 
> A digital filter is available to process a PDM stream.
> The BlueNRG-2 offers the same excellent RF performance of the BlueNRG radio, and the integrated high efficiency DC-DC converter keeps the same ultra-low power characteristics, 
> but the BlueNRG-2 improves the BlueNRG sleep mode current consumption allowing a further increase in the battery lifetime of the applications.
