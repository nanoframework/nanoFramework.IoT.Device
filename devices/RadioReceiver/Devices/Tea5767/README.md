## Usage

**Important**: make sure you properly setup the I2C pins especially for ESP32 before creating the `I2cDevice`, make sure you install the `nanoFramework.Hardware.ESP32 nuget`:

```csharp
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// when connecting to an ESP32 device, need to configure the I2C GPIOs
// used for the bus
Configuration.SetPinFunction(21, DeviceFunction.I2C1_DATA);
Configuration.SetPinFunction(22, DeviceFunction.I2C1_CLOCK);
```

For other devices like STM32, please make sure you're using the preset pins for the I2C bus you want to use.

```csharp
I2cConnectionSettings settings = new I2cConnectionSettings(1, Tea5767.DefaultI2cAddress);
I2cDevice device = I2cDevice.Create(settings);

// The radio is running on FM 103.3MHz
using (Tea5767 radio = new Tea5767(device, FrequencyRange.Other, 103.3))
{
    // Automatic search from current frequency up
    // The larger stopLevel, the fewer radio stations can be searched.
    radio.Search(searchDirection: SearchDirection.Up, stopLevel: 3);
}
```
