// This is the character map for the large 4-row font. 
// The first line gives the character (in UTF8), followed by a colon. 
// the next four lines give the graphic shape of the character. All lines for a character must have the same length, but
// the characters may otherwise differ in width
// Meaning of numbers:
// 0: ◢ (triangle in lower right corner)
// 1: ◥ (triangle in top right corner)
// 2: ◣ (triangle in lower left corner)
// 3: ◤ (triangle in top left corner)
// 4: ▄ (lower half block)
// 5: ▀ (upper half block)
// 6: █ (full block)
// 7: Either a dot, a comma or part of a colon, depending on what was last used as decimal separator
// 9:   (Space, empty block)
// (anything else): Ascii character code
