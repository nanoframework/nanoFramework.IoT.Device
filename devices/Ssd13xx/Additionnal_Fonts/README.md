# SSD1306 sample fonts

Here are sample fonts generated by Bitmap2Font from bitmaps available [here](http://www.orangetide.com/fonts/DOS/).

Each font is constituted by a C# class which needs to be added to your project. You can add them to the sample project and see how the behavior is changing.

Each font is associated with a bitmap to display its complete character set. The bitmap has been added to this repository for convenience.
