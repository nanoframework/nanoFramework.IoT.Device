# LidarLiteV3 - LIDAR Time of Flight Sensor

## Summary

This device belongs to a class of sensors known as time-of-flight, which measures distances by 
calculating the time delay between signal transmission and reception of the signal as it bounces 
off the subject. Unlike the popular sonar-based HC-SR04, this device uses a low-power laser. The 
advantage is longer distances (up to 40m) but more prone to errors when the subject is reflective.
