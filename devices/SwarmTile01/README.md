# Swarm Tile

This library allows using all the features of the satellite module from [Swarm](https://swarm.space/).

## Usage

### Hardware Required

- Swarm Evaluation Kit

![Swarm Eval Kit](./swarm-eval-kit-01.png)

The Swarm Evaluation Kit contains a [Feather S2](https://feathers2.io/) module inside. The code described here (and in the sample application) is based on this hardware. If you're using the library with another nanoFramework module and/or connected to your Swarm Tile you may have to adjust the COM port where it's connected.

For a smoother experience it's recommended that you follow the instructions on Swarm Evaluation Kit guide on how to properly setup the Kit.

### Setup the device in a C# application

You just need to instantiate the `SwarmTile` object and pass the COM port where it's connected to.
On the code snippet bellow that's what's happening along with a event being awaited for the device to become ready.

```csharp
// The COM port where the Tile is connected to
// Using COM1 for the Swarm Evaluation Kit
var swarmTile = new SwarmTile("COM1");

// wait 5 seconds for the Tile to become operational
if(!swarmTile.DeviceReady.WaitOne(5_000, false))
{
    /////////////////////////
    // Tile is not responsive
    /////////////////////////

    Debug.WriteLine("****************************************************************");
    Debug.WriteLine("*** TILE IS NOT RESPONSIVE, POSSIBLY POWERED OFF OR SLEEPING ***");
    Debug.WriteLine("****************************************************************");
}
else
{
    // output device IDs
    Debug.WriteLine($"DeviceID: {swarmTile.DeviceID}");
    Debug.WriteLine($"DeviceName: {swarmTile.DeviceName}");
}
```

### Sending a message

Composing and queuing up a message for transmission requires only a couple of lines of code.

```csharp
// transmit a message to the Swarm network
MessageToTransmit message = new MessageToTransmit("Hello from .NET nanoFramework!");
var msgId = swarmTile.TransmitData(message);

Debug.WriteLine($"Message {msgId} waiting to be transmitted!");
```

### Handling events

The library offers several events to allow using it in a "reactive" fashion. With those one doesn't have to worry about asynchronous events or keep pooling for updates or state changes.

To get notified on a message event (transmitted, expired or received) just add the handler, like this:

```csharp
// setup handler for message events
swarmTile.MessageEvent += SwarmTile_MessageReceived;
```

And add code to process the event.

```csharp
private static void SwarmTile_MessageEvent(MessageEvent messageEvent, string messageId)
{
    switch(messageEvent)
    {
        case MessageEvent.Expired:
            Debug.WriteLine($"Message {messageId} expired without being transmitted.");
            break;

        case MessageEvent.Sent:
            Debug.WriteLine($"Message {messageId} has been successfully transmitted.");
            break;

        case MessageEvent.Received:
            Debug.WriteLine($"Just received message {messageId}.");
            break;

    }
}
```

There are other events available, like power state change, updated date and time, background noise reading and geospatial information.

### Controlling power mode

The Swarm Tile allows controlling the power state of the device to better manage power usage.

To completely power off the device, call this `swarmTile.PowerOff()`.

To have the Tile go into sleep for 60 minutes and wake-up again: `swarmTile.SendToSleep(60 * 60)`.
Upon wake-up a `PowerStateChanged` event is raised.

### Managing messages

To manage messages the Swarm Tile has a local database with two tables: one for messages waiting to be transmitted and another for received messages.
Those tables can be queried, read from and items deleted. The `SwarmTile` expose those as two properties, respectively: `MessagesToTransmit` and `MessagesReceived`.

Available operations to `MessagesToTransmit` table:

- List all messages: `GetAllMessages()`.
- List a specific message: `GetMessage(id)`.
- Delete all messages: `DeleteAllMessages()`.
- Delete a specific message: `DeleteMessage(id)`.
- Number of messages in the table: `Count` property.

Available operations to `MessagesReceived` table:

- List all messages: `GetAllMessages()`.
- List a specific message: `GetMessage(id)`.
- Read a specific message: `ReadMessage(id)`.
- Read the newest received message: `ReadNewestMessage()`.
- Read the oldest message received: `ReadOldestMessage()`.
- Mark a message as read: `MarkMessageRead(id)`.
- Mark all messages as read: `MarkAllMessagesRead()`.
- Delete all messages: `DeleteAllMessages()`.
- Delete all messages that have been read: `DeleteAllReadMessages()`.
- Delete a specific message: `DeleteMessage(id)`.
- Number of messages in the table: `Count` property.
- Number of unread messages in the table: `UnreadCount` property.
