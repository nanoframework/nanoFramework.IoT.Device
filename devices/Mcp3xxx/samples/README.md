# Reading Analog Input from a Potentiometer

You can use .NET Core to read analog values from a [potentiometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimmer_(electronics)), like a [volume control](https://www.adafruit.com/product/356). You can use some sensors with variable resistance instead of potentiometer. Such example exist within samples: [using MCP3008 with FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor)](../../../../samples/force-sensitive-resistor/README.md)   

The Raspberry Pi cannot read analog values directly so relies on an analog to digital converter, like the [MCP3008 ADC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/856). The MCP3008 supports the SPI interface. The 10-bit chip can be accessed as an SPI device or manually via raw GPIO pins. Both options are demonstrated.

## Accessing the MCP3008 via SPI

The Raspberry Pi has support for SPI. You need to [enable the SPI interface on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/08/enabling-the-spi-interface-on-the-raspberry-pi/) since it is not enabled by default.

You can use the following code to [access the MCP3008 via hardware SPI](Mcp3008.Sample.cs):

```csharp
var hardwareSpiSettings = new SpiConnectionSettings(0, 0)
{
    ClockFrequency = 1000000
};

using (SpiDevice spi = SpiDevice.Create(hardwareSpiSettings))
using (Mcp3008 mcp = new Mcp3008(spi))
{
    while (true)
    {
        double value = mcp.Read(0);
        value = value / 10.24;
        value = Math.Round(value);
        Console.WriteLine($"{value}%");
        Thread.Sleep(500);
    }
}
```

The following pin layout can be used (also shown in a [fritzing diagram](rpi-trimpot-spi.fzz)):

* MCP3008 VDD to RPi 3.3V
* MCP3008 VREF to RPi 3.3V
* MCP3008 AGND to RPi GND
* MCP3008 DGND to RPi GND
* MCP3008 CLK to RPi SCLK
* MCP3008 DOUT to RPi MISO
* MCP3008 DIN to RPi MOSI
* MCP3008 CS/SHDN to RPi CE0

## Accessing the MCP3008 via GPIO

You can also access the MCP3008 via GPIO pins, implementing SPI manually. This method is referred to as [bit-banging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface#Example_of_bit-banging_the_master_protocol).

You can use the following code to [access the MCP3008 via GPIO](Mcp3008.Sample.cs):

```csharp
using (SpiDevice spi = new SoftwareSpi(clk: 18, miso: 23, mosi: 24, cs: 25))
using (Mcp3008 mcp = new Mcp3008(spi))
{
    while (true)
    {
        double value = mcp.Read(0);
        value = value / 10.24;
        value = Math.Round(value);
        Console.WriteLine($"{value}%");
        Thread.Sleep(500);
    }
}
```

The following pin layout can be used (also shown in a [fritzing diagram](rpi-trimpot-gpio.fzz)):

* MCP3008 VDD to RPi 3.3V
* MCP3008 VREF to RPi 3.3V
* MCP3008 AGND to RPi GND
* MCP3008 DGND to RPi GND
* MCP3008 CLK to RPi pin 18
* MCP3008 DOUT to RPi pin 23
* MCP3008 DIN to RPi pin 24
* MCP3008 CS/SHDN to RPi pin 25

## Processing the data

Independent of the way in which you access the MCP3008 chip, the code to process its results is the same, which follows.

```csharp
while (true)
{
    double value = mcp.Read(0);
    value = value / 10.24;
    value = Math.Round(value);
    Console.WriteLine(value);
    Thread.Sleep(500);
}
```

The chip is 10-bit, which means that it will generate values from 0-1023 (recall that 2^10 is 1024). We can transform the value to a more familiar 0-100 scale by dividing the 10-bit value by 10.24.
